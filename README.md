# Escape-the-Dungeon ðŸŽ®

This is one of the final projects that I did to one of my subjects of my CFGS studies (find more about this studies here: [GitHub Repository about the studies and the projects I did](https://github.com/manelcagigos/Higher-degree-studies-projects)).

The project was about creating a game using any language and motor that we wanted, I did this project mostly by myself but I did get some help of one of my classmates @leandroqros (he is the person that did the assets of the app, like the logo of the game or the background image of the main page of the game), in my case I used unity to create this game and all the code was writted in C# using Visual Studio 2019.
